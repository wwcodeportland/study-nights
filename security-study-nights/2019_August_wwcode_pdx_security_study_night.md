# Static Code Analysis

Static code analysis is a method of debugging by examining source code before a program is run. It's done by analyzing a set of code against a set (or multiple sets) of coding rules. Static code analysis and static analysis are often used interchangeably, along with source code analysis.

# IDEs to the rescue

Anyone who tells you vim is better at everything hasn't had a bug sneak through that an IDE catches on loading your program.  Some of the best static tools out there are built in or plugins to your IDE.  A good example in Pycharm Community Edition form Jetbrains.  They offer the CE version free for open source contributors.

### https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/code-inspection.html

There are a ton of tools out there aside from IDEs:

We can use deepscan to test against a react open source project

---

Since we come from a variety of languages try and find the tool with the most coverage for the language or framework you're in.

Static analysis is the same idea you use in software development for testing

# Dynamic Code Analysis

Dynamic program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed by executing programs on a real or virtual processor. For dynamic program analysis to be effective, the target program must be executed with sufficient test inputs to produce interesting behavior

Gcov is a source code coverage analysis and statement-by-statement profiling tool. Gcov generates exact counts of the number of times each statement in a program is executed and annotates source code to add instrumentation. Gcov comes as a standard utility with the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) suite.

# [fit] Fuzzing

---

# Fuzzing

Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a quality assurance technique used to discover coding errors and security loopholes in software, operating systems or networks. It involves inputting massive amounts of random data, called fuzz, to the test subject in an attempt to make it crash.

### https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Fuzzing

---

The same tools and techniques used in QA are used by security researchers

---

The great advantage of fuzz testing is that the test design is extremely simple, and free of preconceptions about system behavior
