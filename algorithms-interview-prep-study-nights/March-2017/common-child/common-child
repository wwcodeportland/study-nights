Given two strings a and b of equal length, what's the longest string (S) that can be constructed such that it is a child of both? 

A string x is said to be a child of a string y if x can be formed by deleting 0 or more characters from y. 

For example, ABCD and ABDC has two children with maximum length 3, ABC and ABD. Note that we will not consider ABCD as a common child because C doesn't occur before D in the second string.

Input format

Two strings, a and b, with a newline separating them.

Constraints

All characters are upper cased and lie between ASCII values 65-90. The maximum length of the strings is 5000.

Output format

Length of string S.

Sample Input #0

HARRY
SALLY
Sample Output #0

2
The longest possible subset of characters that is possible by deleting zero or more characters from HARRY and SALLY is AY, whose length is 2.

Sample Input #1

AA
BB
Sample Output #1

0
AA and BB has no characters in common and hence the output is 0.

Sample Input #2

SHINCHAN
NOHARAAA
Sample Output #2

3
The largest set of characters, in order, between SHINCHAN and NOHARAAA is NHA.

Sample Input #3

ABCDEF
FBDAMN
Sample Output #3

2
BD is the longest child of these strings.
