French car license plates look like CG-123-BJ.
They are of the form "ab-cde-fg", where ab and fg range from AA to ZZ, and cde ranges from 001 to 999.

The license plates are generated in alphabetical order:

AA-001-AA, AA-002-AA, AA-003-AA, ..., AA-999-AA,
AA-001-AB, AA-002-AB, AA-003-AB, ..., AA-999-AB,
...,
AA-001-ZZ, AA-002-ZZ, AA-003-ZZ, ..., AA-999-ZZ,
AB-001-AA, AB-002-AA, AB-003-AA, ..., AB-999-AA,
...,
ZY-001-ZZ, ZY-002-ZZ, ZY-003-ZZ, ..., ZY-999-ZZ,
ZZ-001-ZZ, ZZ-002-ZZ, ZZ-003-ZZ, ..., ZZ-999-ZZ.
