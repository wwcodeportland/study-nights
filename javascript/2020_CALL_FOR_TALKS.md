# Hi there!

Thanks for peeking at our schedule for 2020! We're trying something new this year for our study nights: we want to give y'all the chance to talk about your code, or your experience learning JavaScript, or something awesome you've created. This can be a lightning or full talk with some room for questions from our study night goers.

There are some topics below to get the brain juices flowing, but if you have another idea, then great! If you are interested (even the *tiniest* bit) in giving a brief talk on one of them reach out to Haley ([twitter](https://twitter.com/haley_elder) or [email](mailto:hello@haleyelder.com)) ASAP!

## Monthly Topics
Tentatively, study nights are held in the evening on the second Wednesday of every other month, beginning in Feburary. If there is a better time, we can look into some more flexible dates. Keep in mind these topics aren't set in stone and if you'd like to present on something similar or related, please ask.

### Some Examples Include 
- Setting up your first Express server
- Intro to APIs
- Slackbot/Twitter Bots
- creating pull requests, code reviews, writing technical documentation (possibly a series? that's a lot to cover!)
- cross browser testing and polyfill
- create your own chrome extension
- write your first NPM package
- build tools
- intro to Typescript
- JavaScript animations

## What we're looking for presentation-wise

- Someone to enlighten us about all the methods of the brower's console object.
- Someone to enthusiastically tell us how they broke (and fixed) their promises.
- Someone to share their analogies for MVC and MVVM and other design patterns.
- Someone to share their growing collection of tips and tricks for converting ES5 to ES6.
- Someone to live draw the call stack as their script unfolds.
- Someone to tell us JavaScript puns for 8 minutes.
- Someone to sing to us why Typescript is a lifesaver.

The above examples are very specific, but also very made up. We're looking for women interested in either teaching or sharing their experience learning about a specific JavaScript topic, or as often times happens, both!

## Audience Info
Our study nights tend to be on the more intimate side - usually around a dozen to twenty people. The perfect size for getting to know each other, having conversations, and your first or third foray into talking about code in front of a group. Skill levels range from total newbie to years of programming skills.

## Okay, real talk
I know you had a moment of inspiration recently—a slight lift in your heart/chest area—little light bulb emojis in your eyes—if you're thinking this isn't your time to try, I'm telling you it is—come share your light with us.

Again, if you are (even the *tiniest* bit) interested in giving a brief talk on one of the above topics (or a relevant subject), contact Haley ([twitter](https://twitter.com/haley_elder) or [email](mailto:hello@haleyelder.com)) ASAP.
